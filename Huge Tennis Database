#For this analysis, I downloaded the "Huge Tennis Database" from Kaggle and then performed some analysis on the data using SQL. 


#1. Show the first name, last name, and height of all the players from the US
 
SELECT name_first, name_last,height, ioc
FROM players
WHERE ioc = 'USA'
GROUP BY name_first, name_last
ORDER BY avg(height) DESC;

#2. What are the top ten coutries with the most players and how players do they have?

SELECT count(ioc),ioc
FROM players
WHERE ioc IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ioc
ORDER BY count(ioc) DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3. What are the names of every player Barry King beat in a match and where are they from?

SELECT winner_name, loser_name, loser_ioc
FROM matches
WHERE winner_name = 'Barry King';


#4. How many right-handed players are there per country?

SELECT count(hand), ioc, hand
FROM players
WHERE ioc IS NOT NULL AND ioc <> '?' AND hand = 'R'
GROUP BY ioc
ORDER BY count(hand) DESC;
