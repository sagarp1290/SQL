# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert the data into. Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Analysis:

#1. What are the top 10 songs based on popularity and who are the artists?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2. What are the top 5 tracks with the highest average danceability and the highest average duration among all the tracks in the list?
SELECT artist_name,track_name, AVG(danceability), AVG(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC, AVG(duration_ms) DESC
LIMIT 5;

#3. Who are the top 5 artists that appear most on the list and how many times do they appear?

SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) DESC
LIMIT 5;
